INFORMATION
===========

This is AnalogPad Qt widget version 0.1

AnalogPad is basically a 5-way navigation widget, with "analog" behavior
instead of normal digital on/off keys. It is designed to be used with a
touchscreen, in future hopefully with haptics (for real feedback) and
multitouch (for multiple pads!). It's suitable at least for games as well
as other applications where (analog) 5-way navigator works better than
panning/flicking the screen directly.

The package contains:
- This document (README)
- AnalogPad widget sources (analogpad.cpp/h)
- AnalogPad demo sources (mainwindow.cpp/h/ui, main.cpp)
- Project files & license info (analogpad.pro/pro.user, LICENSE.GPL3)
- Prebuild linux binaries for PC (bin/analogpad_linux_pc) and for
  N810 ARM (bin/analogpad_linux_arm)
- Some screenshots (screenshots/*)


HIGHLIGHTS
==========

- AnalogPad supports moving the pad with finger/mouse, as well as clicking
  into directions like traditional 5-way navigation key.

- Uses QPainter for all graphics, no separate pixmap images so
  scaling nicely for different sized. Also not using SVG, so a bit faster in
  embedded devices.

- Contains API for theming by changing colors and animation speed.

- Emitting pad position and clicking with Qt signals, which applications
  can connect to listen.

- To increase performance, widget background is drawn separately into QPixmap
  and only redrawn when necessary.


BUILDING AND RUNNING
====================

Build the AnalogPad widget and demo with:

> qmake
> make

Run with:

> ./analogpad

Optionally one can use pre-built linux binary (Built with Ubuntu 8.04 + Qt 4.4.0):

> ./bin/analogpad_linux

Or in N810:

> ./bin/analogpad_arm


NOTE: Example uses QWebView browser widget and expects access to internet
